This Chrome extension adds a live goal [Vine](https://vine.co/) feed to The Guardian's World Cup live blogs.

For example, 

<img src="vines.png"/>

The feed refreshes every 60 seconds and it should work on all current and [past games](http://www.theguardian.com/football/live).

Pull requests welcome!
